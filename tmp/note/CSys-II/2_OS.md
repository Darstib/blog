## Overview
### What is an OS?

> [!QUESTION]
>
> What is an OS?

- **software layer between the applications and the hardware because the hardware would be too difficult for users to use** .
    - Or: it’s “all the code you didn’t have to write” when you wrote your application
- **It’s a resource abstractor and a resource allocator** (this one)
    - The OS defines a set of logical resources that correspond to hardware resources, and a set of well-defined operations on logical resources
        - e.g., physical resources: CPU, Disks, RAM
        - e.g., logical resources: processes, files, arrays
    - The OS decides who (which running program) gets what resource (share)

### OS is complex

### start an OS

- When a computer boots, it needs to run a first program: **the bootstrap program**
    - Stored in Read Only Memory (ROM)
    - Called the “firmware” or bootloader
    - We use OpenSBI (Supervisor Binary Interface) for our labs
- The bootstrap program initializes the computer
    - Register content, device controller contents, etc.
- It then locates and loads the OS kernel into memory
- The kernel starts the first user-mode process (called “init” on Linux, “launchd” on Mac OS X).. let's see it...
    - first user process runs /sbin/init
    - systemd on newer Linux
    - ps –eaf
- And then, nothing happens until an **event** occurs
    - event: system call, interrupt(timer), hardware instruction ...
    - more on events in a few slides

### Multi-Programming

**Multi-Programming**: Modern OSes allow multiple “jobs” (running programs) to reside in memory simultaneously

- The OS picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory
- When the job has to wait for “something”, then the OS picks another job to run
- This is called a <u>context-switch,</u>  and improves productivity

### Time-Sharing

**Time-Sharing**: Multi-programming with rapid context-switching.

In modern OSes, jobs are called **processes**
- A process is a **running program**

### The Running OS

### A Note on Kernel Size

As a kernel designer you want to be careful to **not use too much** 
**memory!**
- Hence the need to write **lean/mean** code
    - **lean** a nothing more
    - **mean** a single-minded

Furthermore, there is **no memory protection within the kernel**
- The kernel’s the one saying to a process “segmentation fault”
- <u>Nobody’s watching over the kernel</u> 
- So one must be extremely careful when developing kernels

### Protected Instructions

A subset of instructions of every CPU is restricted in usage: only the OS can execute them, known as **protected (or privileged)** instructions

### User vs. Kernel Mode

All modern processors support (at least) two modes of execution:
- **User mode**: In this mode **protected instructions cannot be executed**
- **Kernel mode**: In this mode all instructions can be executed  

- User code executes in user mode
- OS code executes in kernel mode 

- The mode is indicated by a status bit in a protected control register
    - The CPU checks this bit before executing a protected instruction
    - Setting the mode bit is, of course, a protected instruction

### OS Events

- **An event is an “unusual” change in control flow**
    - A usual change is some “branch” instruction within a user program for instance
- **The kernel defines a handler for each event type**
    - i.e., a piece of code executed in kernel mode
- Once the system is booted, all entries to the kernel occur as the result of an event
    - The OS can be seen as a huge event handler

There are two kinds of events: **interrupts** and **exceptions** (or traps or 
faults)
- The two terms are often confused (even in the textbook)
- The term **fault** often refers to unexpected events
- Interrupts are caused by external events
    - **Hardware-generated**
    - e.g., some device controller says “something happened”
- Exceptions are caused by executing instructions
    - **Software-generated**
    - e.g., the CPU tried to execute a privileged instruction but it’s not in kernel mode

```c title="processEvent"
void processEvent(event) {
    switch (event.type) {
        case NETWORK_COMMUNICATION:
            NetworkManager.handleEvent(event);
            break;
        case SEGMENTATION_FAULT:
        case INVALID_MODE:
            ProcessManager.handleEvent(event);
            break;
        ...
    }
    return;
}
```

### Timers

The OS must keep control of the CPU
- OS must have a **concept of “time”**
- Programs cannot gain an unfair share of the computer
- One way in which the OS (or kernel) retrieves control is when an interrupt occurs

To make sure that an interrupt will occur reasonably soon, we can 
use a **timer**.
- The timer interrupts the computer regularly
- The OS always makes sure the timer is set before turning over control to user code
- Modifying the timer is done via privileged instructions, of course.

### Main OS Services

- Process Management
- Memory Management
- Storage Management
- I/O Management
- Protection and Security

### Privileged Instructions

Only privileged instructions can:

- [x] Set value of the system timer
- [ ] Read the clock
- [x] Clear memory
- [ ] Issue a system call instruction
- [x] Turn off interrupts
- [x] Modify entries in device-status table
- [x] Access I/O device

## Structures

### User Operating System Interface

- **Command line interface (CLI)** or command interpreter allows direct command entry
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** User-friendly desktop metaphor interface
- **Touchscreen Interfaces**

### system call

#### concept

When a user program needs to **do something privileged**, it calls a system call (e.g., to create a process, write to disk, read from the network card)

**System Call**: A system call is a special kind of trap. 

> 是 OS 给 user mode 的 interface；例如，调用 "printf" 时。这也说明 system call 本身不是 privated ，因为 user mode 无法调用 privated code.

![](attachments/2_OS-8.png)

#### Implementation

System-call interface maintains a table indexed according to numbers associated with each system call. The system call table is different in different architecture.

> [!KNOWLEDGE]

> ![](attachments/2_OS-9.png)

When we use "printf" (a wrapper of the write system call), actually `mov $0x1, %eax` and `system call` :

![](attachments/2_OS-10.png)

Finishing "printf" the content, it will return to user mode, and continue.

#### example (cp in.txt out.txt)

![](attachments/2_OS-11.png)

> [!QUESTION]

> On Linux there is a “command” called **strace** that gives details about which system calls were placed by a program during execution. What happens if we copy a large file ?

调用的 system call 数量增加，但是种类不变。主要在于 read 等 system call 一次能够操作的内存大小有限，需要反复执行。

#### Time Spent in System Calls

The time command is a simple way to time the execution of a program (used like strace).

It reports three times:
- “real” time: wall-clock time (also called elapsed time, execution time, run time, etc.)
- “user” time: time spent in user code (user mode)
- “system” time”: time spent in system calls (kernel mode)

#### System Call Parameter Passing

- direcly from register
- from a table

![](attachments/2_OS-12.png)
#### Types of System Calls

- Process control
- File management
- Device management
- Information maintenance
- Communications
- Protection

### ELF binary basics

#### Linkers and Loaders

![](attachments/2_OS-13.png)

#### Static link vs dynamic link

- Statically-linked ELF has no .interp section
- Dynamically-linked ELF has .interp section
    - need loader

## Operating System Design and Implementation

### User goals and System goals:

- User goals – operating system should be convenient to use, easy to learn, reliable, safe, and fast
- System goals – operating system should be easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free, and efficient

### Important principle to separate: 

(Allows policy changes without changed implemented mechanism)

- Policy: What will be done?
- Mechanism: How to do it?

### Implementation

![](attachments/2_OS-15.png)

### Microkernels

Moves as much from the kernel into user space.

Benefits:
- Easier to extend a microkernel
- Easier to port the operating system to new architectures
- More reliable (less code is running in kernel mode)
- More secure

![](attachments/2_OS-16.png)

### module

Many modern operating systems implement **loadable kernel modules** (LKMs):

- Uses object-oriented approach
- Each core component is separate
- Each talks to the others over known interfaces
- Each is loadable as needed within the kernel

### Hybrid Systems

macOS and iOS Structure & Android
