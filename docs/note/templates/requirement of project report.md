### Chapter 1: Introduction

Problem description and (if any) background of the algorithms.

### Chapter 2: Algorithm Specification

Description (pseudo-code preferred) of all the algorithms involved for solving the problem, including specifications of main data structures.

### Chapter 3: Testing Results

Table of test cases. Each test case usually consists of a brief description of the purpose of this case, the expected result, the actual behavior of your program, the possible cause of a bug if your program does not function as expected, and the current status (“pass”, or“corrected”, or“pending”).

### Chapter 4: Analysis and Comments

Analysis of the time and space complexities of the algorithms.

Comments on further possible improvements.

### Appendix: Source Code (in C)

At least 30% of the lines must be commented. Otherwise the code will NOT be evaluated.
